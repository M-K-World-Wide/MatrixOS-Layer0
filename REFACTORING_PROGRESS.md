# TrafficFlou Refactoring Progress Report

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Core Architecture Refactoring - COMPLETED**

### ✅ **Completed Tasks:**

#### **1.1 Dependency Optimization**
- ✅ Created `requirements_optimized.txt` with essential dependencies only
- ✅ Removed 40+ unused dependencies (ML, visualization, database, etc.)
- ✅ Organized dependencies by category (Core, Development, Optional)
- ✅ Reduced dependency count from 98 to ~35 essential packages

#### **1.2 Core Architecture Patterns Implementation**

**Abstract Factory Pattern (AI Models):**
- ✅ Created `src/ai_models/factory.py`
- ✅ Standardized AI model creation and management
- ✅ Provider-specific configuration handling
- ✅ Resource management and cleanup
- ✅ Global factory instance management

**Strategy Pattern (Traffic Generation):**
- ✅ Created `src/traffic/strategies.py`
- ✅ Multiple traffic generation strategies
- ✅ Easy strategy switching and composition
- ✅ Performance monitoring for each strategy
- ✅ Extensible strategy framework

**Error Handling System:**
- ✅ Created `src/core/error_handling.py`
- ✅ Custom exception hierarchy
- ✅ Error recovery mechanisms (Retry strategy)
- ✅ Error classification and severity determination
- ✅ Comprehensive error monitoring and statistics

#### **1.3 Code Quality Improvements**
- ✅ Quantum-detailed documentation throughout
